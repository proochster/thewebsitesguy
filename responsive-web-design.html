<h2>What is it?</h2>
<p>Responsive web design is a modern technique of displaying web content across various screen sizes and device types. It combines HTML and CSS properties to achieve it. Mobile phones, tablets, laptops and desktops can use responsive content served from a single source. This means there is no need for developing and maintaining device type specific layouts and websites. One, well organised site can deliver the information to all users.</p>

<p>In addition, users benefit from maximizing the use of their screen real estate. This can be achieved by adjusting elements like font sizes, layout structure or even certain user interactions. The way we navigate through the web differs from one device to another. </p>

<h2>Why is it important?</h2>

<p>With a constantly growing number of devices, especially mobile phones and tablets, website development has to actively adapt to the new requirements. We see new iPhones and Android phones being released, on average, a few times a year. Each model often comes fitted with a new screen size and resolution. The goal of the <strong>Responsive Web Design</strong> is to make the user journey smooth and uninterrupted no matter what device your audience have upgraded too.</p>

<p>Most of us interact with a number of browsing tools every day. You dive into your mobile phone on a busy train or a bus in the morning. At work, desktops and laptops keep you busy. Finally, at home, when you relax on a couch while checking the latest updates on your tablet. Responsive web design helps to deliver a smooth user experience in all situations.</p>
