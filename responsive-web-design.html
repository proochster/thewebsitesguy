<h2>What is Responsive Web Design (RWD)?</h2>
<p><strong>Responsive web design</strong> is a modern technique of displaying web content across various screen sizes and device types. It combines HTML and CSS properties to achieve it. A well designed responsive website provides effortless and uninterrupted access to the content regardless of the device used by your audience. Mobile phones, tablets, laptops and desktops can use responsive content served from a single source. In the consequence it eliminates the need for developing and maintaining device type specific layouts and websites. One, well organized page can deliver the information to all users and saves precious time and resources during development process.</p>

<p>Simultaneously, visitors benefit from maximizing the use of their screen real estate. This is achieved by adjusting page elements like font sizes, layout structure or even certain user interactions.

Finally at home, when we relax on the couch while checking the latest updates on a tablet. Responsive web design helps to deliver a smooth user experience in all situations.</p>
